# 📁 file-Lens

**file-Lens** is a simple, vintage-style Flask app that scans any folder on your system and displays its contents — including **file size, modified date, and full Windows path** — right in your browser.

It’s fast, clean, and nostalgic, inspired by the old-school file explorer look of the 90s 🧠💾
